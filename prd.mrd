Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Project Name: Mirai (placeholder)
Version: 1.0
Owner: Om
Last Updated: 11 Aug 2025

1. Purpose
Mirai is a web-based platform that rewards gym members for workout consistency and diet adherence.
Trainers log member activity to prevent cheating, and credits earned can be redeemed for real-world rewards such as food discounts, movie tickets, spa vouchers, and trips.

The goal is to increase gym retention, motivate members, and create a partner ecosystem where brands benefit from higher footfall.

2. Target Users
Primary:

Gym members aged 18–40 who struggle with workout consistency

Fitness-conscious individuals who value rewards and gamification

Secondary:

Gym trainers who want extra income and tools to track member engagement

Gym owners/managers who want to improve member retention

Reward partners (restaurants, theaters, spas, hotels) who want targeted traffic

3. Problem Statement
Members lose motivation and skip workouts after the initial enthusiasm.

Gyms suffer from low retention and high churn rates.

Trainers have limited earning potential and no structured incentives.

Local businesses lack direct access to active, health-conscious customers.

4. Solution Overview
A platform where:

Trainers log member workouts and diet compliance (no self-logging to reduce cheating).

Members earn credits for each verified activity.

Credits are redeemable with partner brands for real-world rewards.

Membership tiers unlock additional perks (trips, elite discounts, credit multipliers).

Gyms pay per active member or via a monthly plan.

Trainers get per-log commissions and referral bonuses.
